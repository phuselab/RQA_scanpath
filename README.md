# RQAscanpath
Implementation of recurrence quantification analysis (RQA) measures to quantify the similarity of two fixation sequences (or scanpaths).

Based on the paper *Anderson, Nicola C., et al. "A comparison of scanpath comparison methods." Behavior research methods 47.4 (2015): 1377-1392.*

It implements the following metrics:
- Cross-recurrence
- Determinism
- Laminarity
- Center of recurrence mass
